          <p class="post--intro">As a designer, I always used to feel like programming languages were off-limits to me. Recently though, I've been studying Ruby - and acquiring a particular fondness for programming.</p>

      <div class="wysiwyg post--text">

        <p>I recently took an apprenticeship position with the venerable <a href='http://seesparkbox.com'>Sparkbox</a>. They&#8217;re an incredible group of folks who work hard, love what they do, and give back tirelessly to the web industry. The second item of business for my apprenticeship (after spending a few days learning version control with <a href='http://git-scm.com/' title='Git source control'>Git</a> and <a href='https://github.com/' title='Github'>Github</a>) was to learn the <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/' title='Ruby'>Ruby programming language</a>.</p>

<h2 id='a_dash_of_helpful_history'>A Dash of Helpful History</h2>

<p>Now, lest you glaze over that last sentence and remain entirely unimpressed, here&#8217;s a bit of history on the subject of me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drew drawings and painted paintings as a little kid</li>

<li>First did graphic design using a crappy Microsoft publisher tool I can&#8217;t remember the name of (made an ad to sell puppies)</li>

<li>Studied &#8220;Graphic Commercial Art&#8221; at a career high school</li>

<li>Studied <em>Fine Art</em> in college – yes, painting and drawing</li>

<li>Started a <a href='http://sturdy.co'>graphic design company</a></li>

<li>Realized that the web existed and was amazing, so I stumbled through learning HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>I digress. The brief history was given to show you that I&#8217;m just your average dude – more specifically, I&#8217;m just your average designer dude. I love designing stuff - arranging, organizing, communicating, beautifying. I&#8217;m right at home in Illustrator, Photoshop, or InDesign. I consume fonts like candy. I really enjoy <a href='http://dribbble.com/neilrenicker'>Dribbble</a> - sharing my illustration and branding work there is a real thrill. I&#8217;m a designer through and through.</p>

<h2 id='now_that_youre_thoroughly_disgusted_with_my_forthright_attitude'>Now That You&#8217;re Thoroughly Disgusted With My Forthright Attitude</h2>

<p>For some time after I &#8220;discovered&#8221; the web, I was incredibly intimidated by it. I realized that I could be a part of designing websites, but the thought of making them &#8220;clicky&#8221; was off limits for me. I had a friend who had the magical powers, so I designed something in Illustrator and had him code me up a portfolio site for my graphic design business.</p>

<p>As time passed, I realized that maintaining my hands-off relationship with the web was really holding me back. I began selling websites to my clients - I would design a complete system in Photoshop, then pass the designs off to a contractor to code them up for me. I didn&#8217;t understand the development process – I concerned myself with the user experience and graphical elements of my sites.</p>

<p>I grew increasingly fascinated with the way web technology worked, however. I thought &#8220;wow, if so-and-so can build that stuff, I&#8217;m sure I can learn how to do it too!&#8221; So by golly, I did. I bought some HTML books, and studied up on the rhetoric. I browsed <a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/'>Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href='http://37Signals.com'>37Signals</a>, and other sites at the recommendation of a friend, and slowly brought myself up to speed with the Who&#8217;s Whos and the What&#8217;s Whats of the industry from my quiet and lonely little home office of one.</p>

<h2 id='back_to_the_actual_reason_youre_reading_this_article'>Back to the Actual Reason You&#8217;re Reading This Article</h2>

<p>Before too long, I was coding up decent looking sites all by myself - from content strategy to design to development and Content Management System integration. That brings us right up to the present, wherein I jumped at the opportunity to work with the amazing Sparkbox guys for six months to learn their approach to responsive web design and development.</p>

<h2 id='so_whats_ruby_and_why_am_i_excited_to_be_learning_it'>So What&#8217;s Ruby and Why Am I Excited To Be Learning It?</h2>

<p>Ruby is a programming language that lets you write code to tell your computer what to do. It was written by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto'>a really smart dude from Japan</a>. It&#8217;s a lot different than a markup language like HTML or a styling language like CSS - it&#8217;s built to provide logic and flow instead of to primarily create visual experiences. It&#8217;s really popular for creating web applications, especially since it&#8217;s the foundation for a programming framework called Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m amazed and extremely excited to be learning it. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m a visually oriented person. I always thought I was too &#8220;right brain&#8221; to learn a complex programming language. That might be true, but I&#8217;m learning it anyway.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s not as hard to learn as I thought it would be. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are days that I want to go home and weep in my bed because I feel so frustrated and confused about what I&#8217;m trying to learn. There are days I feel so discouraged about my (lack of) progress that I want to give up and go design puppy ads. But by and large, I&#8217;m not completely stumped. I&#8217;m picking things up. I&#8217;m getting a feel for the language. I&#8217;m starting to grasp the basic constructs of programming in general. I&#8217;m learning Ruby. This isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m unusually brilliant - I&#8217;m just determined! You could do the same.</li>

<li>I love building things. Becoming comfortable with programming languages like Ruby and Javascript will remove more barriers standing in the way of my desire to build. I&#8217;ll feel more in control of my projects, have a clearer sense of the work required to make them run, and know what to do when things break.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote this post mainly to encourage you (if you&#8217;re a designer) to try to learn a programming language. It will <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3451-learning-rails-made-me-a-better-designer' title='Learning Rails Made Me a Better Designer'>make you a better designer</a> in the long run. You don&#8217;t have to worry about being the best programmer in the world - you just have to get started. You&#8217;ll develop a deeper respect for programmers who are really good at their craft, you&#8217;ll find that learning new technologies in the future becomes easier, and best of all, <em>you&#8217;ll be able to build stuff</em>.</p>
