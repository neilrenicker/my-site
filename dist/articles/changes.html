      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p class="post-meta"><time>July 19, 2013</time></p>
      
      <p class="post-intro">None of us really knows what waits for us around the next corner. Change is inevitable, and sometimes it's welcome. The next leg of my journey is at <a href="http://seesparkbox" title="Sparkbox">Sparkbox</a> - a change I eagerly accept.</p>
      
    </header>
    
    <p>A little over six months ago, I spent my working hours mostly in solitude. I was a freelancer, living the freelancer&#8217;s dream. I ran a small design shop; I had wonderful clients, fast internet, a pot of coffee always on, and the novelty of a self-managed schedule.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve turned a corner, though. After six months of training at my <a href='http://seesparkbox.com/apprenticeships'>Sparkbox apprenticeship</a>, I&#8217;m excited to say that I&#8217;ve accepted a position as a front-end developer there. I won&#8217;t be working from home as much, I won&#8217;t be managing clients, and I won&#8217;t be the master of my own schedule. There are a few things I <em>will</em> be doing, though, as a result of this welcome change:</p>

<p><strong><em>I&#8217;ll be enjoying the company of my new friends every day.</em></strong> I&#8217;m a certain introvert - I <a href='http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-april-3/'>recharge on alone time</a>, and big groups of people stress me out. But the camaraderie of a few kind friends does wonders for morale - and I&#8217;ve become convinced that I do better work now that I&#8217;m surrounded by people whose skill and passion surpasses my own.</p>

<p><strong><em>I&#8217;ll be a part of something bigger than myself.</em></strong> As a solo act, I developed a thick skin, and a strong spirit of self-sufficiency. These are valuable traits to be sure! Managing clients and handling projects alone carved out a rugged can-do, self-starter mentality in me that I still enjoy the benefits of. But there&#8217;s a whole side of life that I was unwittingly missing out on - the joy of working on a <em>team</em>, where the praise and criticism and responsibility of the group are all evenly distributed. There&#8217;s a sense of jolly brotherhood in this arrangement that puts a song on my lips and feather in my step.</p>

<p><strong><em>I&#8217;ll be able to learn and teach to a degree that I hadn&#8217;t experienced before.</em></strong> In some ways, I felt that during my apprenticeship, I learned more in that six months than I ever could have in six years of tackling the same problems alone. Conversely, I&#8217;ve been given opportunities to teach and <em>share</em> the things I&#8217;ve learned in ways I&#8217;d only dreamed about before. I certainly don&#8217;t think you have to be in a team environment to grow and share, but occasional accountability and encouragement are a great fit for my personality.</p>

<p><strong><em>I&#8217;ll be able to narrow my focus to doing mainly what I&#8217;m good at.</em></strong> I&#8217;m not a great businessman. I did decently at managing my business because I was the only one to do it. My first love is the work itself, though. Being an employee means I can focus in with precision and passion on what I do best.</p>

<p>So Sparkbox is the <a href='http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/meet_neil'>next leg of my journey</a>. I&#8217;m excited about what I can give, and what I can take. The changes are stark, but the change is worth it.</p>
