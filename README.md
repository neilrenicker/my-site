All the codes for the future [neilrenicker.com](http://neilrenicker.com). Built with love, late nights, and darker than normal coffee.

## Images

* All images are retina-fied using [picturefill.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill).
* Syntax: date-title-size (example: `130612-on-the-go-small.jpg`, `130612-on-the-go-small@2x.jpg`)
* Save as **progressive**
* Run through image minifier

Here are the size templates for common image areas:

1. Home page (`img/home`)
  * small: 640px w (+ @2x)
  * medium: 275px w/h (+ @2x)
2. Post pages (`img/articles`)
  * large: 900px w

## Art Direction

* If a post is to have custom art direction, the markup should live in front matter called `art:`. Indent markup 2 spaces. It will be included in an otherwise empty, unstyled `<div>` with a class of `art-top`.
* Custom styles for that post should be placed in a `.scss` file within `templates/_scss/posts/post-date-and-name.scss`. Sass file should be named the exact name of the post. Update the `CSS:` front-matter to match the file name (no extension) of the Sass file.
