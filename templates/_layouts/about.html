    <p class="content-featured-intro">I'm a quiet midwest designer focused on interfaces and illustration. I run the small web design shop Sturdy, where I enjoy flinging front-end code and consuming copious amounts of deep black coffee. I’m happily married to Mandalyn, and I’m planning to be promoted to the office of “Dad” this June.</p>

    <h1>A little more...</h1>
    <p>I want to be remembered as a husband, dad, and friend that truly loved people and truly loved Jesus. With my career, I'd like to be remembered as a helpful, smart, and visually solid web designer and illustrator who truly loved people and truly loved Jesus.</p>
    <p>Generally, I'd like to be known as a user interface designer who is extremely comfortable with code, and has a flair for illustration. I think I'll have more success getting in the public eye with helpful projects, ideas, and words, rather than a particular visual "style".</p>

    <p>I keep track of quotes I find particularly inspiring on my <a href="http://neilrenicker.tumblr.com" title="neilsbrain on Tumblr">Tumblr</a>. One of them is published here for you to enjoy. Isn't that nice?</p>
