intro: Your time is precious! Don't waste it starting and stopping your Harvest timer. My Harvest workflow for Alfred will make tracking time fun again.

I use [Harvest][0] every day for tracking time to projects. Harvest makes time tracking as painless as it can be, I suppose. The web app UI is uncluttered and sane. The feature set is just right. The [Mac app][1] is suitable. And [the API][2] is clean and well-documented.

What more could a worker ask for?

Well, not much… except an Alfred workflow to control the timer. You *are* using [Alfred][3], aren't you? It's a simple yet insanely powerful little Mac app for launching applications, opening files, and best of all, running custom scripts (or "workflows") to speed up repetitive tasks. It's the first application I install when I get a new Mac, and it's the one you probably shouldn't wait another moment to [go download][4] if you don't have it already.

Once you've downloaded Alfred and purchased the [Powerpack][5] (just get it—you'll thank me later), you'll be all ready to speed up your Harvest time tracking. I wrote a simple workflow for Alfred to manage Harvest timers. I fondly call it **alfred-harvest**, and it's here for you to kick the tires and drive around the block.

Here's what **alfred-harvest** can do:

* view today's timers
* start / stop a timer
* view and add notes
* launch your Harvest web app

For the impatient, [view releases and download from Github](https://github.com/neilrenicker/alfred-harvest/releases). For the rest of you, animated gifs:

**Starting a new timer:**

**Toggling today's timers:**

**Adding a note:**

That's the way you do it! I hope you enjoy the workflow as much as I do. [Check out the project on Github](https://github.com/neilrenicker/alfred-harvest/), or [head directly to the downloads page](https://github.com/neilrenicker/alfred-harvest/releases).
