More often than not, I design with a knot in my stomach most of the way through my projects.

There's a cloud of doubt, self-pity, and mild despair that hangs over me until I'm about 75% into the project. Then for the last 25%, the pendulum swings violently the opposite direction and I feel like my creation is incredible. By the time I send the work off, I'm right in the middle where I need to be: excited about the work, but not so enthusiastic as to be naive and blind to the possibility that it could be improved upon.

It's that first 75% that is the risky part. The knot in my stomach is powerful - if I let it, it will kill the whole idea. If I leave it alone and press through with the job, it eventually dies and the project turns out OK or even excellent.
<blockquote> "And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, <strong>they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.</strong>"
