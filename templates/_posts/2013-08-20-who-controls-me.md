intro: We have a lot of control over each other, whether we realize it or not. We have the power at our disposal to crush or encourage, vilify or embolden. Which are we choosing?

If you belong to any sort of peer group (all of us do - work, family, friends, clubs, organizations), you probably know what it's like to feel controlled by someone other than yourself.

It always amazes me the power a single person can wield over me. People who are more extroverted, confident, better looking, better dressed, more wealthy, more talented, more intimidating, more well-spoken, more powerful, more famous than Iâ€¦ they're all candidates for usurping the throne of my control center.

It only takes one person I respect to turn the cold shoulder on me to crush me. It only takes one sharp criticism from someone I trust to deflate my enthusiasm for a project. It only takes one thoughtless joke from a peer to undermine my abilities and halt my progress. As a Christian, I'm always aiming to find my security in the God who made me - but there's no denying that the people who surround me assume that place in my life more often than I'd like.

The longer I live, the more I bump into people who don't validate, encourage, or even acknowledge me. I've been learning that 1) these folks don't have the final say on who I am as a person, and 2) if I'm waiting for validation to do something amazing, I'll never get it. There isn't any one person who has the skill to command my control center - why would I let them?

We have a an incredible amount of control over each other. What if we leveraged that to encourage and inspire, instead of discourage and deflate?
