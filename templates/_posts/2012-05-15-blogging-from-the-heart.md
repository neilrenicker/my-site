I’ve blogged for quite awhile over at my company site, <a href="http://renickerstudio.com/">renickerstudio.com</a>. It’s been a good run, but I’ve realized in the last month or so that I’m not really blogging about stuff that I like.

I’ve been posting things about marketing, business operations, and other somewhat stuffy items, and I’m ready to really have fun with my writing and be true to my voice. The blogs that I love to read are those which are honest, poignant, or otherwise stimulating – and I don’t feel like my company blog is really doing that.

So here’s my stab at blogging from the heart. I’m excited – if you like what I write, great. If you don’t, that’s fine too! I want like blogging, and for me that means I’ll blog what I want to. Not what you want me to.

Expect things related to design, tech, art, Christianity, and philosophy. That’s what I do. I hope you’ll tag along!

From the heart,

Neil
