A little over six months ago, I spent my working hours mostly in solitude. I was a freelancer, living the freelancer's dream. I ran a small design shop; I had wonderful clients, fast internet, a pot of coffee always on, and the novelty of a self-managed schedule.

I've turned a corner, though. After six months of training at my [Sparkbox apprenticeship](http://seesparkbox.com/apprenticeships), I'm excited to say that I've accepted a position as a front-end developer there. I won't be working from home as much, I won't be managing clients, and I won't be the master of my own schedule. There are a few things I *will* be doing, though, as a result of this welcome change:

***I'll be enjoying the company of my new friends every day.*** I'm a certain introvert - I [recharge on alone time](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-april-3/), and big groups of people stress me out. But the camaraderie of a few kind friends does wonders for morale - and I've become convinced that I do better work now that I'm surrounded by people whose skill and passion surpasses my own.

***I'll be a part of something bigger than myself.*** As a solo act, I developed a thick skin, and a strong spirit of self-sufficiency. These are valuable traits to be sure! Managing clients and handling projects alone carved out a rugged can-do, self-starter mentality in me that I still enjoy the benefits of. But there's a whole side of life that I was unwittingly missing out on - the joy of working on a *team*, where the praise and criticism and responsibility of the group are all evenly distributed. There's a sense of jolly brotherhood in this arrangement that puts a song on my lips and feather in my step.

***I'll be able to learn and teach to a degree that I hadn't experienced before.*** In some ways, I felt that during my apprenticeship, I learned more in that six months than I ever could have in six years of tackling the same problems alone. Conversely, I've been given opportunities to teach and *share* the things I've learned in ways I'd only dreamed about before. I certainly don't think you have to be in a team environment to grow and share, but occasional accountability and encouragement are a great fit for my personality.

***I'll be able to narrow my focus to doing mainly what I'm good at.*** I'm not a great businessman. I did decently at managing my business because I was the only one to do it. My first love is the work itself, though. Being an employee means I can focus in with precision and passion on what I do best.

So <a href="http://seesparkbox" title="Sparkbox">Sparkbox</a> is the [next leg of my journey](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/meet_neil). I'm excited about what I can give, and what I can take. The changes are stark, but the change is worth it.
