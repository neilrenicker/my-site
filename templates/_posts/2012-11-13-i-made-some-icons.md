The community on the web gives me so much â€“ helping me grow in my craft and inspiring my work. I wanted to make a little something to give away and share with those who have shared with me.

Since winter is just around the corner, I whipped up some icons in Illustrator for you to download and use as you please. They might work well for a Christmas card or email, or printed out on wrapping paper.
