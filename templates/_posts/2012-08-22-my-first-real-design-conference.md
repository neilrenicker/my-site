I'm headed to the illustrious <a href="http://aneventapart.com">An Event Apart</a> design conference this weekend in Chicago.

I feel like a giddy kindergartener the night before his first day of school. I'm *excited! *There – I said it. I can't wait for this thing, and here's why:

1. **I've never been to a design conference.** I've never been to a design conference of this caliber before. Well, come to think of it, I've never been to a design conference at all! That's why this is so important to me.
2. **I'm sick of living on an island.** I work for myself, from home. I love this, but I start feeling really selfish and isolated. I'm really looking forward to getting outside of my comfort zone, meeting other folks, and talking to people in the web industry.
3. **I'm thirsting to learn.** I'm a young designer, and even younger in my web design career. I'm thankful to know what I know, but I have the ever-present sense that I have a lot to learn. Bring it on! I'm thirsting to learn.

To celebrate, I redesigned my blog. What's that you asked? *What* design? I know, I know – it's not much. But it has everything I need for now. It will be a work in progress.

So I'm off to The Windy City. We'll talk later.
