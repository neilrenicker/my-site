I took off two days last week to stay at home, be with my family, and work on side projects. I expected to be inspired and diligent. I had a simple, yet ambitious plan for creating things.

In short, it did’t work. I didn’t write any articles (ironically, I’m writing this article before work on the Monday *after* this mini vacation). I got a little done, but for the most part, I was sidetracked and a bit bored. Bored! I’m never bored! I contrast this with the “filled-to-the-brim”, “always-on” inspiration I feel during the work week when I’m supposed to be working on other things.

I’ve said this before, and it’s still as true as ever: *I’m most inspired when I should be working on something else.* What’s the thread there? What’s the magic that’s present during regular working hours, but vanishes during vacation or dedicated “side project” time?

* Passive thought? Does my brain have a peripheral thought life that flourishes when not given direct attention?
* Time gluttony? Do I thrive under the constraints and pressure of small time slots, but get fat and lazy whenI have a large block of time to do whatever I want?
* Bad working habits? I’m constantly optimizing my work to get the most out of the time I have, but I wonder if the prospect of 2-3 full days of working on stuff I love awakened all my bad working habits I used to know and hate.

At any rate, I think the takeaway for me right now is to be thankful that I have a day job—and not resent that I don’t have more time to work on side projects. The time that I create to write, work on side projects, and self-teach may be short , but it is focused, efficient, and more valuable than day upon day of free time.

*My day job may be my side projects’ biggest fan.*
