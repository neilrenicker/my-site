I'm trying to get faster at using my terminal. I plan for this to become a growing list of shortcuts I want to commonly use for speedier terminal navigation.

I realize there are [references][1] for this sort of thing alreadyâ€”but this isn't meant to be comprehensive. It's meant to be a simplified and helpful layman's guide. This is mainly for my own benefit, but as always, you're welcome to follow along.

### Clearing and navigation:

* Delete line up to beginning: `Ctrl + U`
* Delete complete line: `Ctrl + A, Ctrl + K`
* Cancel current command: `Ctrl + C`.
* Recall last deleted command: `Ctrl + Y`
* Go to beginning of line: `Ctrl + A`
* Go to end of line: `Ctrl + E`
* Remove words ahead: `Ctrl + K`
* Remove characters to left, until beginning of word: `Ctrl + W`
