Here are a few things that I'm struggling with, and want to do better at:

* **Start speaking.** Start local, work up. Don't be intimidated by the fact that my knowledge is small / growing. Gotta start somewhere, man.
* **Answer phone calls.** Not everybody works like me, and I can't expect them to change just because I want them to. While emails may be more comfortable, phone calls are fine, and I can't be trustworthy if I don't pick up the phone.
* **Enjoy the process.** I'm so busy looking across the fence at people I admire who are better than me that I forget to enjoy the task at hand. That's bad and dumb.
* **Get stuff done.** Related to 3. If I'm not faithful with these little things, who will ever trust me for big things? Part of moving up is being really faithful right where I am.
